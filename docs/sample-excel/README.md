## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Step 1: Validate Template Locally
```bash
# Count rows (should be small for initial testing)
wc -l students-template.csv

# Check encoding
file -i students-template.csv
# Expected: charset=utf-8

# Preview content
head -n 5 students-template.csv
```

### Step 2: Test Upload
1. Start the mock server
2. Navigate to admin panel
3. Select template file
4. Click upload
5. Verify success message

### Step 3: Verify in Database
```bash
# For SQLite
sqlite3 backend/database/ho_yu_college.db "SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = 'STU011';"

# For PostgreSQL
docker exec -it ho-yu-college-db psql -U ho_yu_dev -d ho_yu_college -c "SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = 'STU011';"
```
