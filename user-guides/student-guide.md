## ‚≠ê Understanding the Marking System

### How Marks Are Calculated

You earn marks based on two factors:

1. **Play Time**: How long you play the game (in minutes)
2. **Difficulty Level**: The difficulty of the game

**Formula**: `Play Time (minutes) √ó Difficulty Multiplier = Marks Earned`

**Difficulty Multipliers**:
- **Beginner**: √ó1
- **Intermediate**: √ó2
- **Advanced**: √ó3

### Examples

- Play a **Beginner** game for **10 minutes** = 10 √ó 1 = **10 marks**
- Play an **Intermediate** game for **15 minutes** = 15 √ó 2 = **30 marks**
- Play an **Advanced** game for **20 minutes** = 20 √ó 3 = **60 marks**

> üìù **Note**: 
> - Minimum play time is 1 minute to earn marks
> - Marks are awarded when you leave the game page
> - You can play the same game multiple times to earn more marks
